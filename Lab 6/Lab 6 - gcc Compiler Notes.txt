**C/C++**

The C/C++ compiler comes with Raspberry Pi (Raspbian version 4.4.34) is GNU Compiler Collection. To compile a C file (HelloWorld.c as an example), run the following command:

    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Os HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld

The `-Wall` flag enables a set of warnings (but not all warnings). `-Wextra` enables extra warning. `-Werror` forces the compiler to treat a warning as an errors. This three flags could be very useful when debugging. With `-Os` flag, all debug symbols will be stripped, and compiler will optimize the generated executable (smallest, fastest). Debug symbols are useful for debugging the code, but when using the executable instead of debugging/testing, optimized version is prefered ("cleaner", faster). `-o` and the following string specifies output (path and) name. Without this flag and its argument, the compiler will use "current path" and would probably generate an executable named something like "a.out" if the name is not occupied.

After running the command, an executable named HelloWorld should appear if there is no error.

Similarly, to compile a C++ source code (HelloWorld.cpp):

    g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Os HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld

GCC also supports programming languages: Objective-C, Objective-C++, and GO.

**Java**

Java (Version 1.8.0) is pre-installed in Raspbian. There is also GUI IDE in Raspbian Menu - Programming - BlueJ Java IDE.

<br>
**Python**

If you love using python, python 2.7.9 and python 3.4.2 come with Raspbian. there are also GUI python IDE, you can find them in Raspberry Menu - Programming - Python 2 (IDLE) / Python 3 (IDLE).

**Your Preference**

You can also install your favoriote compiler, such as clang. Run the following command in a terminal:

    sudo apt-get install clang

Clang has a similar syntax when compiling C/C++ source code:

For C code:

    clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Os HelloWorld.c -o HelloWorld

For C++ code:

    clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Os HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld
